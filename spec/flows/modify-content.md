# Modifying content

Overwriting information in existing content, or changing properties inside a
specific piece of content can be done by combining modules.

## Translating content

An interesting application of content modification is to translate the content of
a module to another language.

This can be done simply by replacing all the values (and not the properties) to
the desired language.
