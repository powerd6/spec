# Modifying content

Overwriting information in existing content, or changing properties inside a
specific piece of content can be done by [combining modules](./combine-module.md).

## Translating content

An interesting application of content modification is to translate the content of
a module to another language.

This can be done simply by replacing all the values (without adding or removing
properties) to the desired language.

Keep in mind some templates may also need to be translated.
