# Render a module

Rendering a module creates a finished book with all the content rendered properly.

Content is rendered with the following logic:

- Alphabetically, based on the schema name
- Alphabetically, based on the content id

<!-- TODO: should schema also have a `sortFunction` property to help with this? -->
