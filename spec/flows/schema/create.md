# Creating a schema

When creating a schema define it with the appropriate language.

Schemas don't need to have rendering logic, but it is appreciated. Its possible to keep rendering logic as a separate module, but that complicates things.

Use a fuzzing tools to check how the rendered output looks like with sample data.
