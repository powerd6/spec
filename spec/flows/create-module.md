# Create a module

A module is nothing more than a file that contains content, schema, and some
information regarding it's authorship.

Modules are distributed as [JSON](https://www.json.org/) files,
validated by [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
The format of these module files are validated by the
[`module.schema.json`](../../schema/module.schema.json) file.
